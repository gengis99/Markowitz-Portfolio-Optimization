# Markowitz-Portfolio-Optimization
Portfolio Optimization using the Markowitz Model: This repository contains Python scripts and a LaTeX report on portfolio construction based on the Markowitz mean-variance optimization model. The analysis focuses on 10 large-cap US stocks, with a complete workflow from data preprocessing to portfolio optimization.

This project implements the Markowitz mean-variance optimization model for portfolio construction. The analysis is conducted using historical stock data from 10 large-cap US companies, providing a practical approach to asset allocation with the goal of minimizing risk or maximizing return.

## Project Structure
- **`report.tex`**: LaTeX source file for the portfolio optimization report.
- **`modello_markovitz.ipynb`**: Folder containing Python scripts used for data retrieval, preprocessing, and optimization.

## Libraries Used
- **Python**: For data extraction, manipulation, and optimization.
- **yfinance**: For retrieving historical stock data.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the data and results.
- **SciPy**: For optimization and numerical methods.
